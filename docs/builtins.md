# Built-in Types and Functions

**Bend** built-in types and functions, this document serves as a reference guide. Read more at [FEATURES.md](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/Bend/blob/main/FEATURES.md).

## String

```python
type String = (Cons head ~tail) | (Nil)
```

- **Nil**: Represents an empty string.
- **Cons head ~tail**: Represents a string with a `head` character and a `tail` string.

### Syntax

A String literal is surrounded with `"`. Accepts the same values as characters literals.

```
"Hello, World!"
```

## List

```python
type List = (Cons head ~tail) | (Nil)
```

- **Nil**: Represents an empty list.
- **Cons head ~tail**: Represents a list with a `head` element and a `tail` list.

### Syntax

A List of values can be written using `[ ]`, it can have multiple values inside, using `,` you can divide its value in a list of multiple elements.

```
["This", "List", "Has", "Multiple", "Values"]
```

### Functions

#### List/length

```python
def List/length(list: [a]) -> (length: u24, list: [a])
```

Returns a tuple containing the length and the list itself.

#### List/reverse

```python
def List/reverse(list: [a]) -> [a]
```

Reverses the elements of a list.

#### List/flatten

```python
def List/flatten(list: [[a]]) -> [a]
```

Returns a flattened list from a list of lists. Example:

```python
List/flatten([[1], [2, 3], [4]])

# Result: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

#### List/concat

```python
def List/concat(xs: [a], ys: [a]) -> [a]
```

Appends two lists together. Example:

```python
List/concat([1, 2], [4, 5])

# Result: [1, 2, 4, 5]
```

## Tree

```python
type Tree:
  Node { ~left, ~right }
  Leaf { value }
```

**`Tree`** represents a tree with values stored in the leaves.
Trees are a structure that naturally lends itself to parallel recursion, so writing your problem in terms of trees is a good first approach to parallelize your code.

- **Node { ~left ~right }**: Represents a tree node with `left` and `right` subtrees.
- **Leaf { value }**: Represents one of the ends of the tree, storing `value`.

#### Syntax

**Bend** provides the `![]` operator to create tree branches and the `!` operator to create a tree leaf.

```py
# ![a, b] => Equivalent to Tree/Node { left: a, right: b }
# !x      => Equivalent to Tree/Leaf { value: x }
tree = ![![!1, !2],![!3, !4]]
```

Technically your trees don't need to end with leaves, but if you don't, your program will be very hard to reason about.

## Map

```python
type Map:
  Node { value ~left ~right }
  Leaf
```

**`Map`** represents a tree with values stored in the branches.
It is meant to be used as an efficient map data structure with integer keys and O(log n) read and write operations.

- **Node { value ~left ~right }**: Represents a map node with a `value` and `left` and `right` subtrees. Empty nodes have `*` stored in the `value` field.
- **Leaf**: Represents an unwritten, empty portion of the map.

#### Syntax

Here's how you create a new `Map` with some initial values.:

```python
{ 0: 4, `hi`: "bye", 'c': 2 + 3 }
```

The keys must be `U24` numbers, and can be given as literals or any other expression that evaluates to a `U24`.

The values can be anything, but storing data of different types in a `Map` will make it harder for you to reason about it.

You can read and write a value of a map with the `[]` operator:

```python
map = { 0: "zero", 1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three" }
map[0] = "not zero"
map[1] = 2
map[2] = 3
map[3] = map[1] + map[map[1]]
```

Here, `map` must be the name of the `Map` variable, and the keys inside `[]` can be any expression that evaluates to a `U24`.

## Map functions

### Map/empty

Initializes an empty map.

```python
Map/empty = Map/Leaf
```

### Map/get

Retrieves a `value` from the `map` based on the `key`.
Returns a tuple with the value and the `map` unchanged.

```rust
Map/get map key =
  match map {
    Map/Leaf: (*, map)
    Map/Node:
      switch _ = (== 0 key) {
        0: switch _ = (% key 2) {
          0:
            let (got, rest) = (Map/get map.left (/ key 2))
            (got, (Map/Node map.value rest map.right))
          _:
            let (got, rest) = (Map/get map.right (/ key 2))
            (got, (Map/Node map.value map.left rest))
        }
        _: (map.value, map)
      }
  }
```

#### Syntax

Considering the following map

```python
{ 0: "hello", 1: "bye", 2: "maybe", 3: "yes"}
```

The `get` function can be written as

```
return x[0]  # Gets the value of the key 0
```

And the value resultant from the get function would be:

```
"hello"
```

### Map/set

Sets a `value` in the `map` at the specified `key`.
Returns the map with the new value.

```rust
Map/set map key value =
  match map {
    Map/Node:
      switch _ = (== 0 key) {
        0: switch _ = (% key 2) {
          0: (Map/Node map.value (Map/set map.left (/ key 2) value) map.right)
          _: (Map/Node map.value map.left (Map/set map.right (/ key 2) value))
        }
        _: (Map/Node value map.left map.right)
      }
    Map/Leaf:
      switch _ = (== 0 key) {
        0: switch _ = (% key 2) {
          0: (Map/Node * (Map/set Map/Leaf (/ key 2) value) Map/Leaf)
          _: (Map/Node * Map/Leaf (Map/set Map/Leaf (/ key 2) value))
        }
        _: (Map/Node value Map/Leaf Map/Leaf)
      }
  }
```

#### Syntax

Considering the following tree

```python
{ 0: "hello", 1: "bye", 2: "maybe", 3: "yes"}
```

The `set` function can be written as

```py
x[0] = "swapped"     # Assigns the key 0 to the value "swapped"
```

And the value resultant from the get function would be:

```py
{ 0: "swapped", 1: "bye", 2: "maybe", 3: "yes"}
```

If there's no matching `key` in the tree, it would add a new branch to that tree with the value `set`

```py
x[4] = "added"     # Assigns the key 4 to the value "added"
```

The new tree

```py
{ 0: "swapped", 1: "bye", 2: "maybe", 3: "yes", 4: "added"}
```

### Map/map

Applies a function to a value in the map.
Returns the map with the value mapped.

```rust
Map/map (Map/Leaf)                  key f = Map/Leaf
Map/map (Map/Node value left right) key f =
  switch _ = (== 0 key) {
    0: switch _ = (% key 2) {
      0:
        (Map/Node value (Map/map left (/ key 2) f) right)
      _:
        (Map/Node value left (Map/map right (/ key 2) f))
    }
    _: (Map/Node (f value) left right)
  }
```

#### Syntax

With the same map that we `set` in the previous section, we can map it's values with `@=`:

```py
x[0] @= lambda y: String/concat(y, " and mapped")
# x[0] now contains "swapped and mapped"
```

## Nat

```python
type Nat = (Succ ~pred) | (Zero)
```

- **Succ ~pred**: Represents a natural number successor.
- **Zero**: Represents the natural number zero.

### Syntax

A Natural Number can be written with literals with a `#` before the literal number.

```
#1337
```

## IO

The basic builtin IO functions are under development and will be stable in the next milestone.

Here is the current list of functions, but be aware that they may change in the near future.

### Printing

```python
def IO/print(text)
```

Prints the string `text` to the standard output, encoded with utf-8.

### Input

```python
def IO/input() -> String
```

Reads characters from the standard input until a newline is found.

Returns the read input as a String decoded with utf-8.

### File IO

#### File open

```python
def IO/FS/open(path, mode)
```

Opens a file with with `path` being given as a string and `mode` being a string with the mode to open the file in. The mode should be one of the following:

- `"r"`: Read mode
- `"w"`: Write mode (write at the beginning of the file, overwriting any existing content)
- `"a"`: Append mode (write at the end of the file)
- `"r+"`: Read and write mode
- `"w+"`: Read and write mode
- `"a+"`: Read and append mode

Returns an U24 with the file descriptor. File descriptors are not necessarily the same as the ones assigned by the operating system, but rather unique identifiers internal to Bend's runtime.

#### File descriptors for standard files

The standard input/output files are always open and assigned the following file descriptors:

- `IO/FS/STDIN = 0`: Standard input
- `IO/FS/STDOUT = 1`: Standard output
- `IO/FS/STDERR = 2`: Standard error

Returns a list of U24 with each element representing a byte read from the file.

```python
def IO/FS/read_until_end(file)
```

Reads until the end of the file with the given `file` descriptor.

Returns a list of U24 with each element representing a byte read from the file.

```python
def IO/FS/read_file(path)
```

Returns nothing (`*`).

```python
def IO/FS/write_file(path, bytes)
```

#### File seek

```python
def IO/FS/seek(file, offset, mode)
```

Moves the current position of the file with the given `file` descriptor to the given `offset`, an I24 or U24 number, in bytes.

`mode` can be one of the following:

- `IO/FS/SEEK_SET = 0`: Seek from start of file
- `IO/FS/SEEK_CUR = 1`: Seek from current position
- `IO/FS/SEEK_END = 2`: Seek from end of file

Returns nothing (`*`).
